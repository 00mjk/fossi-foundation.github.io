The Foundation's goals can be achieved with your support in a couple of ways.

1. Sponsorship packages - if you'd like to support the FOSSi Foundation by becoming a tiered sponsor, get in touch via <a href="mailto:fossi-fundraising@lists.librecores.org?subject=FOSSi sponsorship enquiry">fossi-fundraising@lists.librecores.org</a> and the details on our sponsorship packages.

2. Developers - setting up our infrastructure takes work and we're interested in having more people to lend a hand. See our <a href="/archive.html">News &amp; Posts</a> section for the latest requests, or contact us at  <a
href="mailto:info@fossi-foundation.org">info@fossi-foundation.org</a> to offer your help maintaining and developing our sites like <a href="https://librecores.org">LibreCores</a>.

3. Talk. We encourage discussion on all things open source digital design and FOSSi on the LibreCores discussion mailing list: <a
href="mailto:discussion@lists.librecores.org">discussion@lists.librecores.org</a>
(<a href="https://lists.librecores.org/listinfo/discussion">subscribe
here</a>). A few of us are also hanging out on IRC (#librecores at
freenode).

4. Individual donations. You can also support us with small donations via Paypal:
