4. Update on benchmarks
- -----------------------

Roger Shepherd will report on his progress with benchmarking other
platforms.

Paolo Savini and Jeremy Bennett have recently re-run the Embench 0.5
benchmarks to obtain data for GCC 10.2 and a historical record of
performance for Arm on versions of Clang/LLVM. They will report results

5. Publicity
- ------------

Stefan Wallentowitz is putting together an interview style blog post
about Embench, based on interview responses from Dave Patterson and
Jeremy Bennett

A new version of a generic presentation on Embench will be circulated
at the meeting.

Ben Marshall has raised the question of a standard citation for
Embench. Currently he is using:

@misc{embench-iot,
title={Embench: Open Benchmarks for Embedded Platforms},
author={David Patterson and Jeremy Bennett and Palmer Dabbelt, Cesare
Garlati and G. S. Madhusudan and Trevor Mudge},
howpublished=&quot;\url{<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot</A>}&quot;
}

He has asked if there is a better citation he should be using.

Jeremy Bennett is giving a keynote talk at the 3rd Workshop on RISC-V
Activities held by Edacentrum, Germany. The talk will be looking at
the RISC-V Software Ecosystem. The final part of the talk explores the
importance of benchmarking in developing that ecosystem.

- - talk abstract: <A HREF="https://www.edacentrum.de/risc-v-software-ecosystem">https://www.edacentrum.de/risc-v-software-ecosystem</A>

Jeremy Bennett is speaking at VSDOpen on 10 October, a conference for
students in India. Although the talk has quite a broad abstract, it
will use Embench as an example of the bridge between hardware and
software in open source.

6. Embench 0.6
- --------------

There is an ongoing shared document to add potential programs for a
new floating point benchmark suite:

<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ</A>

Ray Sinar and his students at RICE are leading the effort to develop
the FP benchmark suite with his students during the coming semester.
Ray to report.

A reminder that we need volunteers to lead particular aspects of
current and future efforts.
