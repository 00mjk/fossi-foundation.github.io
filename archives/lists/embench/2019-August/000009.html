Hi Jon,

I agree with you on this. I propose doing the same as we have with a
number of other problematic functions (e.g. rand), and providing an
Embench version in the support library. All that matters is that the
benchmark should fail (i.e. exit with a non-zero return code) if
assert is triggered, so this can be much simpler than the full library
assert.
&gt;<i> Related to the library and size thread, assert also creates a
</I>&gt;<i> challenge in calculating overhead, since assert uses some code in
</I>&gt;<i> common with printf. This means that if printf is used in other
</I>&gt;<i> common code (eg UART output), the size differential between the
</I>&gt;<i> nettle tests and the empty test does not give an accurate size
</I>&gt;<i> calculation. If library size is included in the overall benchmark
</I>&gt;<i> measurement, then we need to try and make the common library code
</I>&gt;<i> as consistent as possible. Multiple dummy/empty tests might be
</I>&gt;<i> another approach, but that adds a maintenance overhead.
</I>
Yes - I've run into this before. My proposed fix will deal with this.
Once I have the patch, I'll post it here.
&gt;<i> I’m happy to be challenged on this if I’ve missed a good reason
</I>&gt;<i> for leaving them in place.
</I>
Thanks for spotting the issue.

Best wishes,


Jeremy
