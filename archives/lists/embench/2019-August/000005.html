Hi all,

Jon Taylor from ARM has posed some useful questions about how Embench
measures code size. This is a new thread to get input from the community.

I think we can do better, and would welcome on advice on improved
approaches.

Background
- ----------

At present, the scripts measure size by building a benchmark with
dummy libraries and dummy startup code. This minimizes the impact of
such code on the measurement. Since libraries are not typically
rebuilt with the same compiler options, they can provide a constant
bias on each benchmark measurement.

This is particularly the case with the relatively small benchmarks we
have in Embench. We can see this if we compare ARM and RISC-V
benchmarks out of the box. Most of the time ARM appears to be much
larger, but this is because its startup code is much more general
purpose than RISC-V, and adds 4Kbyte to the code size. Strip this out
and ARM code comes out generally somewhat smaller than RISC-V.

Conversely in the few benchmarks that have floating point
calculations, ARM does very well, due to its hand-optimized floating
point library.

By using dummy startup code and libraries, we can remove this bias.

However...

The programs will not then execute, so there is no guarantee that the
compiler has generated correct code. There is also much greater
potential for global inter-procedural optimization (LTO) than would be
the case with real libraries.

I refer to this current approach as &quot;Option 0&quot;. Here are some other
options which might be better.

Option 1: Just accept the bias
- ------------------------------

We could just accept that the bias is there, and use size as measured.
This option relies on very few assumptions about the target and tools.

The problem with this, that with small programs, the bias is
substantial and we lose a lot of insight. Instead of being able to see
which architecture and compiler features are beneficial, we just
measure start-up code and library design for the architecture.

Option 2: Have a dummy benchmark with no code to subtract
- ---------------------------------------------------------

This would give us a good result, but with garbage collection of
sections, modern tool chains only link in the code they actually use.
So we would need a different dummy for each benchmark, potentially
quite complex to construct. This gets even harder with LTO,
potentially moving code in and out of libraries.

This option starts to require more assumptions about the target and tools.

Option 3: Just count the size of the object files before linking
- ----------------------------------------------------------------

This is relatively straightforward to do.  The problem is that it
precludes any benchmarking of link time optimizations such as
global-interprocedural optimization (LTO). Given the importance of
such techniques, this significantly reduces the value of Embench to
the compiler community.

This option makes relatively few assumptions about the target
architecture and tools.

Option 4: Subtract the size of the startup and library code
- -----------------------------------------------------------

We can look at the compiled binary and subtract any code/data
associated with libraries and startup.

This would be compatible with link time optimizations, although with a
measurement error if such optimizations migrate benchmark code to/from
library code.

This option makes assumptions about code and data layout. For example
that a function starts at its label and ends at the label with the
next highest address.

Option 5: Link but measure only benchmark code
- ----------------------------------------------

This is a combination of options 3 and 4. We look at the benchmark
code pre-linking to determine the symbols used in the benchmark code
and data.  We then link and only count the size of the symbols from
the benchmark code.

Also potentially vulnerable to error with link time optimizations, and
makes all the same assumptions as options 3 and 4.

Option 6: Statistically eliminate the bias
- ------------------------------------------

This uses the current option 0 and option 1, to provide a per
benchmark estimate of startup and library code size. This still
actually includes dummy code size, but potentially option 4 could we
used to estimate this.

This makes relatively few assumptions about target and tools (at least
without option 4), but might be hard to explain to people.


Feedback very welcome.

Thanks,


Jeremy
