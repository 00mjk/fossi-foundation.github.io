Hi all,

These are the notes from last week's meeting, summarizing actions.

3. New GitHub issues
- --------------------

Two issues have been raised.

<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/59">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/59</A>
- - A request for clarity in documenting the use of CPU_MHZ
- - Assigned to Paolo Savini to investigate.
- - Thanks to Tilak Girijeswar for raising this.

<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/60">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/60</A>
- - A request to use stdint types throughout.
- - This has been discussed and decided in the past
- - The documentation should be updated to reflect this.
- - Assigned to Paolo Savini to resolve.
- - Thanks to Tilak Girijeswar for raising this.

The following issues have been closed

<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/31">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/31</A>
- - explanation provided.

<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/40">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/40</A>
- - bug fixed by patch from Paolo Savini

<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/47">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/47</A>
- - explanation provided

<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/51">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/51</A>
- - bug fixed by patch from Mark Hill

<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/52">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/52</A>
- - bug fixed by same patch as for issue 40.

<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/53">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/53</A>
- - explanation provided

Thanks to all those who provided explanations and patches.

4. Update on benchmarks
- -----------------------

Work is nearing completion on the embench-iot-results repository. Goal
is to have this clean and ready to accept new submissions in the next
few days.

ACTION: Jeremy Bennett to complete work on the embench-iot-results
respository.

Paolo Savini presented a slide showing the impact of GCC 10.1 on
Embench results for RISC-V and Arm Cortex-M4. Both cores have
improved, although Arm has improved its execution speed slightly more
than RISC-V.

ACTION: Paolo Savini to distribute his slide.

Jeremy Bennett has publicised current vendors of the reference board
on the mailing list, but has yet to update the documentation.

ACTION (continued): Jeremy Bennett to update the documentation with
more details to make the board easier to find in future.

5. Publicity
- ------------

Our paper is on standby for Hot Chips, which will be a virtual
conference this year.

We should consider submitting to Arm TechCon.

ACTION: David Patterson/Jeremy Bennett. Chase up what is happening for
Arm TechCon.

[Post-meeting note: The call for papers has now come out, and David
Patterson will draft a proposal]

6. Embench 0.6
- --------------

General agreement that the new version must use the size of actual
executables, not dummy libraries.

Desire to add a floating-point suite, with up to 1MB program size

General agreement that the MLPerf TinyML benchmark (250kB) would be a
good candidate for this:
<A HREF="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/person_detection">https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/person_detection</A>

There are several BEEBS benchmarks that might be suitable for a
floating point benchmark.

ACTION: Paolo Savini to explore suitable BEEBS floating point benchmarks.

It was noted that GPS uses double precision floating point, including
in IoT devices, so might be a source of suitable benchmarks.

ACTION: Jeremy Bennett. Set up a shared Google doc for people to
record suggestions.

[Post-meeting note: This is now set up. Anyone may suggest edits:
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ</A>
]

The question was asked if there were graphics applications that might
be suitable.

ACTION: All. Reach out to friends in embedded computing for
suggestions, including DSP suggestions.

7. Future meetings
- ------------------

We currently meet regularly on the third Monday of each month 8-10am
California time. Our future meetings will be. Note that 2 dates have
been changed to accommodate upcoming conferences/holidays.
- - Mon 15 Jun 2020
- - Mon 20 Jul 2020
- - Mon 10 Aug 2020 (changed)
- - Mon 21 Sep 2020
- - Mon 19 Oct 2020
- - Mon 16 Nov 2020
- - Mon 14 Dec 2020 (changed)

I've created a calendar entry for our regular attendees, to provide
automated reminders. Please ask if you wish to be added to this.

8. AOB
- ------

Kyriakos Georgiou reported on progress with an Ada version of Embench,
written in Ada/SPARK (hence no run-time errors)
- - 13 benchmarks converted
- - harder to do for library based benchmarks
- - can compile for STM Discovery Board
  - still WIP
- - currently private due to Innovate UK restrictions
  - will be made public in June
- - have found bugs in the existing benchmarks!

Nidal Faour reported that Western Digital have started open sourcing
their enterprise build system
- - complete in 5-6 weeks
- - will replace the existing Python scripts.

Best wishes,


Jeremy
