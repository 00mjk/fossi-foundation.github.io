<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/73">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot/issues/73</A>
- - other benchmarks use GCC extensions
- - generalization of issue 72, also assigned to Paolo Savini
- - thanks to Kjetil Østerås of Silicon Labs for the issue report

- From embench-iot-results:

<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot-results/issues/4">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot-results/issues/4</A>
- - what is the performance of baseline board at full-speed
- - flat out would be affected by Flash memory access times.
- - assigned to Paolo Savini to investigate.
- - Thanks to Charles Papon (Dolu1990) for raising this.

Thanks to all those who raised issues and provided responses.

4. Update on benchmarks
- -----------------------

Issues 72 and 73 highlighted the lack of an agreed standard for C and
C++ langauges to be used. The meeting agreed to use C11 for C programs
and C++11 for C++ programs.

Roger Shepherd is working on new data for ST platforms. Running into
some tool problems

ACTION (ongoing): Roger Shepherd to provide Embench results for ST dev
boards, Apple Macs and Raspberry Pi.

Paolo Savini is still working on Atmel AVR

ACTION (ongoing): Jeremy Bennett/Paolo Savini to attempt to get
results for Atmel AVR using Arduino.

5. Publicity
- ------------

No success on standby at HotChips

The Wikipedia page: <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embench,">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embench,</A> now talks
about the results repository, but the link was removed. Suggest
putting it in as a footnote.

Jeremy Bennett had an action to explore alternatives to Google for the
standard presentation. There is work in progress on a version in
ReStructuredText using Sphinx/Hieroglyph version here:

<A HREF="https://github.com/jeremybennett/embench-iot/tree/presentations">https://github.com/jeremybennett/embench-iot/tree/presentations</A>

Some of the tables are stretching the limits of ReStructuredText. Any
suggestions welcome.

An alternative would be Beamer (LaTeX for slides).

ACTION (ongoing): Jeremy Bennett to explore alternatives to Google
Docs - possibly restructured text or hieroglyph, which could be held
in a repository.

David Patterson has submitted a talk to Arm Techcon

Jeremy Bennett will approach ORConf about presentation

David Patterson is blogging. Possibly could write about Embench 0.6.

6. Embench 0.6
- --------------

There is an ongoing shared document to add potential programs for a
new floating point benchmark suite:

<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ</A>

Ray Simar reported on BDTI benchmarks and conversation with Jeff Bier.
Definitely interested, perhaps pick just two benchmarks at first.
Looking at two Ray's graduate students helping with this in the Fall.

Jeff Bier is also looking at embedded inference engines, and
interested in helping with this. Ray planning TinyML project in his
class this Fall.

David Patterson suggested the possibility of floating point and
quantized versions of AI engines as described in the TinyML book.

ACTION (ongoing): Ray Simar to set class project to come up with new
benchmarks based on the TinyML book.

ACTION (ongoing): Ray Simar to continue work on BDTI benchmarks,
including how they would be licensed (anything GPL compatible is fine).

Paolo Savini has considered candidate floating point benchmarks from
BEEBS, with matmult-float, ludcmp, qurt, sqrt, fasta, stb_perlin and
frac as being plausible candidates. Suggest matmult-float, ludcmp, and
possibly qurt as the priorities.

Nikos Fragoulis talked about their deep learning technologies. Looking
at the smallest LeNet-5 network, 60kB (integer) or 240kB (floating
point) of data.

Do we need bigger networks in the future? Nikos presented models of
various sizes.

ACTION (ongoing): Nikos Fragoulis to propose benchmark and suitable
data from Irida Labs

Ray Simar to leave FP benchmark initiative.

ACTION: Jeremy to set up repository, with Ray as co-owner. Paolo and
Nikos can contribute their code into that repository.

Timescale: Ray's course starts in late August, and wrap up by
Thanksgiving.

SiFive had some interesting vector benchmarks. Could we do a vector
benchmark suite in the future? Subject for a future meeting.

7. Future meetings
- ------------------

Future meetings will be 1 hour long.

We currently meet regularly on the third Monday of each month 8-10am
California time. Our future meetings will be. Note that 2 dates have
been changed to accommodate upcoming conferences/holidays.

- - Mon 10 Aug 2020 (changed)
- - Mon 21 Sep 2020
- - Mon 19 Oct 2020
- - Mon 16 Nov 2020
- - Mon 14 Dec 2020 (changed)

I've created a calendar entry for our regular attendees, to provide
automated reminders. Please ask if you wish to be added to this.

ACTION: Jeremy to reissue 10 August invitation.

Best wishes,


Jeremy
