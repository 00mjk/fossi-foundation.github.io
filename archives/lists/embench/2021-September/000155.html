<PRE>Hi Paolo,

Thanks for promoting the issue with M4 testing for embench-rt.
I want to elaborate that this is a blocker for promoting test results for interrupt latency.
It means we have a test suite running, but we have not published any results yet, since M4 is the reference (as on Embench-iot)



Another missed AI from embench-rt&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-meetings/blob/main/meetings/2021/2021-09-20-agenda.md#from-embench-rt">https://github.com/embench/embench-meetings/blob/main/meetings/2021/2021-09-20-agenda.md#from-embench-rt</A>&gt;, is that the there were comments/questions on the PR which we answered.
If there are no more comments, I would like to merge them.

I will add comments to the PR itself and merge it by next month if no one has any additional questions.


Thanks,
Ofer

Hi all,

here are the minutes from the Embench meeting of Monday 20 September 2021.

There's a question that still hangs as there were quite a few people
missing at the meeting.

We recall that a student in a past meeting bravely volunteered to work
on the embench-rt project. If anyone recalls that would they please give
a shout? Unfortunately the name was missed in the minutes but we are
keen to get in touch.

Best wishes,

Paolo Savini
