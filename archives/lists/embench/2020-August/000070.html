Hi all,

Our next regular meeting of the Embench group will be tomorrow Monday,
10 August, 8-9am California time. This is a week earlier than our
regular cycle because of possible conference clashes next week.

Since it is only 3 weeks since our last call, this may be a relatively
light meeting.

We shall meet using the same Zoom details as before. I have changed
the settings to remove the waiting room, so there should be no delays
in joining from now on.

Please email me if you do not have the Zoom meeting details - I am
reluctant to post details on an open mailing list.

4. Update on benchmarks
- -----------------------

Roger Shepherd will report on his progress with benchmarking other
platforms.

5. Publicity
- ------------

We were unfortunately not accepted for Arm TechCon

Jeremy Bennett is speaking at VSDOpen in October, a conference for
students in India. Although the talk has quite a broad abstract, it
will use Embench as an example of the bridge between hardware and
software in open source.

6. Embench 0.6
- --------------

There is an ongoing shared document to add potential programs for a
new floating point benchmark suite:

<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ</A>

This has been updated with the candidate programs from BEEBS.

Ray Sinar is leading the effort to develop the FP benchmark suite with
his students during the coming semester.

A reminder that we need volunteers to lead particular aspects of
current and future efforts.

7. Next meeting
- ---------------

We currently meet regularly on the third Monday of each month 8-10am
California time. Our future meetings will be. Note that the Decmember
date has been changed to avoid the week before Christmas.
- - Mon 21 Sep 2020
- - Mon 19 Oct 2020
- - Mon 16 Nov 2020
- - Mon 14 Dec 2020 (changed)

At our next meeting, I shall propose dates for 2021.

I've created a calendar entry for our regular attendees, to provide
automated reminders. Please ask if you wish to be added to this.

8. AOB

Best wishes,


Jeremy Bennett
