Subject: Re: [Embench] How to measure code size fairly



Hi All...

Giving the initial proposal for “how to measure code size fairly” I wish to give more industrial/commercial approach.

First question is “why”, why to take this approach? The answer is that usually small footprint devices are very strict on memory (can be on the spectrum-range of bytes-kBytes),

commercial companies will like to see more real compare cases, on different targets with and without compiler tweaks.

I think this will emphasize the benefit of one target on another and therefor eventually contribute to Embench



Second question is, on which code we should base our compression? Can we take performance benchmarks for example?

Answer:  yes we can take it, but it will not emphasis code size and real usage.



Code to use (benchmarks):

---------------------------

It is fairly to say that on the last decade (and more) MCUs main usage become controlling the SoC rather than running complex algorithms and complex applications.

If you need I2C controller, Jpeg encoder, encryption/decryption, etc, you put it on the SoC and dont give the protocol handling to the SW/FW.

This lead me to the following code benchmarks to use:

a.    Vendors will like to see I/F drivers benchmarks.

•    Popular drivers for IO: SPI, UART, USB, I2C, IR,  etc… (some can be written in bit-banging approach)

•    Popular drivers for RF devices: wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc…

•    Popular drivers for image and audio processing: JPEG, MPEG, Dolby, pcm, SRS…

•    Popular drivers for networking chips

•    We can bring more…

Note: that those I/F highlight ld/st usage since the code will use a lot of memory access (aka register space),

this will emphasis the differences between targets on compiler and ISA aspects.

b.    RTOS - Vendors sometimes use RTOS on small devices if that fit in the memory budget, which is why RTOS footprint is so important.

Therefor I think it will be wise to put small RTOSs as a benchmark.

The problem is that most of does small RTOSs are not free (like Micrium, ThreadX,…), but we can start from FreeRTOS.

I don’t think Zephier will fit here, although it is open source, since it based on VxWorks and it will not fit small devices. Having said that, it is still usefully as a benchmark.



How to test:

-------------------------

When testing size we actually testing the ISA and the compiler, I don’t think we need to separate them and we can open the door here for complex compatibility issues,

but we can follow some “rules” (Many comments in the initial proposal are good guidelines so I will leverage them):



•    LTO is pure toolchain side, we can run each benchmark with and without it. This will highlight apples-to-apples on each target

•    We need to pass link stage since RV heavily relay on relaxation

•    Do not use libraries – AT ALL. This can bring noise (as already mentioned on the initial proposal) which is not needed. Small device are not likely to use any libs.

•    Test code can be put in it is own section (text + data) and we will measure just those sections and not the entire .text



Summarizing:

---------------------

Although this approach will emphasize code size, for products with small memory budget, it will also highlight the differences between targets on the size aspect.

Traditional benchmarks are more aiming to performance, “which core is better?”, but size can sometime be the main deal-breaker to choose a core.



Thanks,

Ofer

Hi Ofer,



I take your point that the kernels may not be the dominant factor in an overall application size; but I'm still concerned that we shouldn't be ignoring library size, particularly when libraries may be the most significant fraction of a kernel. If it's a small fraction - then great, it doesn't matter overall anyway. But for tests (such as cubic) where it is a very large fraction, it seems odd to choose to ignore it.



Having some more complete applications is potentially interesting, although the scope gets harder to strictly define to ensure comparisons are like-for-like. For instance you could also then consider aspects such as MPU/PMP reprogramming, and context switch timings may become more meaningful if you're measuring OS behaviour, rather than just the kernel of a context switch. But I think that's a whole other thread and we still need to get the basic elements (such as context switch kernel) in place first.



Regards,



Jon

Hi Jon,

I want to share my two cents regarding code size.

Measuring code size is a different approach from checking performance for

synthetic/none-synthetic benchmarks.

While performance is tested over libs and applicative code (like crc, SHA,

Fourier transform, etc...), checking size over those will be unreverent since

usually embedded FW will have more &quot;control code&quot; then  &quot;library usage&quot;.

For example, FW can use JPEG encoder and it will take 4kB of size in some

target, but the overall code of the program will be 100 or 1000 bigger.

Today IoT device are &quot;fighting&quot; over several bytes how we measure code size

(we call small embedded devices IoT today just because it fits to the concept,

but we can have big ones as well) so?



Well, I think that practice comparison is one of the options. If we have a code

that we spotted that have difference between ARM/RV/x86/Other we can

use it as a &quot;test case&quot;.

This code will have randomly C functionality  (loops, ifs, inline, etc...) Of

course that this will be massively depend on the compiler but also on the ISA

and ABI rules, we already spotted cases like this internally and we open

source those test cases.



Another approach will be to use &quot;big FW applications&quot; which use a lot of

randomly C functionality, like RTOS.

For example we can examine what is the size of FreeRTOS with RV32IMC vs

ARM (Thumb 2). This will be very interesting to small embedded devices that

depend on RTOS, this can highlight how much one target is better/worst

then the other, from size perspective.



Thanks,

Ofer

Thanks Jeremy.



Firstly my opinion is that any code we're measuring the size or

performance of needs to be functional. If an algorithm requires lots

of maths library code (such as cubic), there is a benefit to having an

optimised library available and that should be reflected in a

benchmark score. This could also include allowing a library optimised

for a processor with custom instruction extensions.  I'm really not

sure what measuring the performance of something that can't be

executed really tells us - for example &quot;cubic&quot; is about 1k of code

with dummy libraries, but ~9k with libraries (Arm GCC, building - O2).

We wouldn't measure the runtime without libraries, so why would

measuring the size without libraries be considered valid?



Having said that, I think it likely (particularly for benchmarks run

on actual hardware), use of printf might be desirable for recording

the runtime (eg via a UART, trace port or other mechanism), but

measuring the size of the printf library is not helpful because it's

effectively only for debug, not functional purposes.  Comparing code

with and without printf, the print library adds ~20k to Arm code size,

and ~60k to RISC-V; when many of the tests are a kb or two in size,

this massively distorts the results. Having an empty test allows this

to be discarded, since the printf would be in common code and thus

compiled into the empty test too.



I'm not sure I understand the point about needing a different dummy

for each benchmark. My expectation is that a test consists of:

&lt;bootcode&gt;

&lt;test initialisation&gt;

&lt;start timer&gt;

&lt;test&gt;

&lt;stop timer&gt;

&lt;possible cleanup code&gt;



We want to discount everything that is not &lt;test&gt; - and an empty test

would achieve this (assuming that we are happy counting library code

that is required by the benchmarks). Everything outside of &lt;test&gt;

should be common code across all of the tests, so only a single dummy

is needed. I do think we need to allow for LTO being used as it can

offer some significant size and performance benefits, but we should

investigate whether it distorts the results significantly.



Kind regards,



Jon

Hi all,



Jon Taylor from ARM has posed some useful questions about how

Embench

measures code size. This is a new thread to get input from the

community.



I think we can do better, and would welcome on advice on improved

approaches.



Background

- ----------



At present, the scripts measure size by building a benchmark with

dummy libraries and dummy startup code. This minimizes the impact of

such code

on

the measurement. Since libraries are not typically rebuilt with the

same compiler options, they can provide a constant bias on each

benchmark measurement.



This is particularly the case with the relatively small benchmarks

we have in Embench. We can see this if we compare ARM and RISC-V

benchmarks out

of

the box. Most of the time ARM appears to be much larger, but this is

because its startup code is much more general purpose than RISC-V,

and adds 4Kbyte to the code size. Strip this out and ARM code comes

out generally somewhat smaller than RISC-V.



Conversely in the few benchmarks that have floating point

calculations,

ARM

does very well, due to its hand-optimized floating point library.



By using dummy startup code and libraries, we can remove this bias.



However...



The programs will not then execute, so there is no guarantee that

the compiler has generated correct code. There is also much greater

potential

for

global inter-procedural optimization (LTO) than would be the case

with real libraries.



I refer to this current approach as &quot;Option 0&quot;. Here are some other

options which might be better.



Option 1: Just accept the bias

- ------------------------------



We could just accept that the bias is there, and use size as measured.

This option relies on very few assumptions about the target and tools.



The problem with this, that with small programs, the bias is

substantial and we lose a lot of insight. Instead of being able to

see which architecture and compiler features are beneficial, we just

measure start-up code and library design for the architecture.



Option 2: Have a dummy benchmark with no code to subtract

- ---------------------------------------------------------



This would give us a good result, but with garbage collection of

sections, modern tool chains only link in the code they actually use.

So we would need a different dummy for each benchmark, potentially

quite

complex to construct. This gets even harder with LTO, potentially

moving code in and out of libraries.



This option starts to require more assumptions about the target and tools.



Option 3: Just count the size of the object files before linking

- ----------------------------------------------------------------



This is relatively straightforward to do.  The problem is that it

precludes any benchmarking of link time optimizations such as

global-interprocedural optimization (LTO). Given the importance of

such techniques, this significantly reduces the value of Embench to the

compiler community.



This option makes relatively few assumptions about the target

architecture and tools.



Option 4: Subtract the size of the startup and library code

- -----------------------------------------------------------



We can look at the compiled binary and subtract any code/data

associated with libraries and startup.



This would be compatible with link time optimizations, although with

a measurement error if such optimizations migrate benchmark code

to/from library code.



This option makes assumptions about code and data layout. For

example

that

a function starts at its label and ends at the label with the next

highest address.



Option 5: Link but measure only benchmark code

- ----------------------------------------------



This is a combination of options 3 and 4. We look at the benchmark

code

pre-

linking to determine the symbols used in the benchmark code and data.

We

then link and only count the size of the symbols from the benchmark

code.



Also potentially vulnerable to error with link time optimizations,

and makes all the same assumptions as options 3 and 4.



Option 6: Statistically eliminate the bias

- ------------------------------------------



This uses the current option 0 and option 1, to provide a per

benchmark estimate of startup and library code size. This still

actually includes dummy code size, but potentially option 4 could we used

to estimate this.



This makes relatively few assumptions about target and tools (at

least without option 4), but might be hard to explain to people.





Feedback very welcome.



Thanks,





Jeremy
