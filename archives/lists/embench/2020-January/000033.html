Hi all,

These are the notes from last month's meeting.

2. GitHub pull requests
- -----------------------

Pull request 29 from Ola Jepsson was approved, so long as it was not
the default.

3. New GitHub issues
- --------------------

Bruce Hoult has offered a new computational program. It was proposed
that a new branch be started to collect programs for use in future
releases of Embench, with this as the first program.

4. Website analytics
- --------------------

Server side analytics are now working and will be reported at the next
call.

5. New baseline
- ---------------

It was agreed that the Arm Cortex M4 was a more appropriate baseline
for the benchmark. Jon Taylor had provided some advice on the need to
accurately specify the M4 variant used, and in particular not to use
hardware floating point.

ACTION: Jeremy Bennett to report Arm data at the next meeting.

Foundation Conference about presenting this year.

The website needs to link to data on the results repository.

ACTION: Jeremy Bennett and Dave Patterson to send Cesare Garlati their
RISC-V Summit slides for adding to the website.

ACTION: Cesare Garlati to provide more content for the website.

ACTION: Jeremy Bennett to talk to Stefan Wallentowitz about adding a
Twitter feed to the website.

10 More data

There is now a proof of concept repository for results.
