4. Update on benchmarks
- -----------------------

Paolo Savini shared the latest results.

Slide 7 - mention board and compiler version

Compare with Arm - were cache's used - probably not for Cortex M4

Slide 25 needs warning not to use

Is outlining implemented for RISC-V Clang/LLVM?

For bit manipulation slides 27-30 could show actual scores

Need to get real hardware for RISC-V results. HiFive1?

5. Publicity
- ------------

Stefan Wallentowitz is putting together an interview style blog post
about Embench, based on interview responses from Dave Patterson and
Jeremy Bennett.

ACTION: Jeremy to push to conclusion with Embecosm

A new version of a generic presentation on Embench will be circulated
at the meeting.

ACTION: Jeremy Bennett to finalize in light of feedback and circulate
with minutes.

Ben Marshall has raised the question of a standard citation for
Embench. Currently he is using:

@misc{embench-iot,
title={Embench: Open Benchmarks for Embedded Platforms},
author={David Patterson and Jeremy Bennett and Palmer Dabbelt, Cesare
Garlati and G. S. Madhusudan and Trevor Mudge},
howpublished=&quot;\url{<A HREF="https://github.com/embench/embench-iot">https://github.com/embench/embench-iot</A>}&quot;
}

He has asked if there is a better citation he should be using.

Reference tagging.

There is also a SIGArch blog post.

Should we have an archive paper? Can update as we go. Also may last
longer than GitHub. History and current results

ACTION: David Patterson to prepare draft paper.

David Patterson spoke at the Embedded Vision conference last week.
Follow up Q&amp;A on22 September

Jeremy Bennett is giving a keynote talk at the 3rd Workshop on RISC-V
Activities held by Edacentrum, Germany. The talk will be looking at
the RISC-V Software Ecosystem. The final part of the talk explores the
importance of benchmarking in developing that ecosystem.

- - talk abstract: <A HREF="https://www.edacentrum.de/risc-v-software-ecosystem">https://www.edacentrum.de/risc-v-software-ecosystem</A>

Jeremy Bennett is speaking at VSDOpen on 10 October, a conference for
students in India. Although the talk has quite a broad abstract, it
will use Embench as an example of the bridge between hardware and
software in open source.

6. Embench 0.6
- --------------

There is an ongoing shared document to add potential programs for a
new floating point benchmark suite:

<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ</A>

Ray Sinar and his students at RICE are leading the effort to develop
the FP benchmark suite with his students during the coming semester.
Ray to report.
- - focus on DSP benchmarks from BDTI (FIR, IIR, FFT, vector dot-product)
- - teams have been formed - 10 person team
- - set of goals  as go through semester
- - getting benchmarks written should be good
- - challenges around data, self-testing
- - want to run on some microprocessor platforms
  - talked to Arm, SiFive and Tensilica
- - carry on past this semester, hope to keep going
- - wrestle with practical issues between floating point and fixed point
  - easier to start with floating point
  - BDTI came from fixed point
- - students can also sign up for TinyML (3 dozen signed up)
  - going to produce benchmark, but not main task
    - David Patterson noted that MLPerf has a TinyML effort

Willing to accept more ideas for floating point
- - Mark Hill suggested Kalman filter

A reminder that we need volunteers to lead particular aspects of
current and future efforts.
