Hi all,

Our next regular meeting of the Embench group will be on Monday, 9

at a conference on the originally advertised date.

We will meet using the same Zoom details as before. Please email me if
you do not have them - I am reluctant to post details on an open
mailing list.

Update from Cesare Garlati
Jeremy Bennett will report on progress with Stefan Wallentowitz on
obtaining better website data (action in progress from previous meeting).

5. EEMBC process
- ----------------

Jeremy Bennett will report on his meeting with Peter Torelli at
Embedded World.

6. Update on benchmarks
- -----------------------

Support for the new baseline, using the Cortex M4 processor was
committed in time for the Embench 0.5 release.

After including the documentation updates from Jon Taylor and David
Patterson, the repository was tagged as embench-0.5. The source code
is available as a ZIP or compressed tar download for those not wishing
to do battle with git.

All future development on the master branch will be towards Embench
0.6, with a goal of reaching Embench 1.0 before the end of the year.

A new version of the embench-iot-results repository is in progress to
allow results to be captured.

7. Process and documentation
- ----------------------------

Updates from Jon Taylor and David Patterson were merged into the
repository prior to the Embench 0.5 release.

8. Publicity
- ------------

Jeremy Bennett will report on the launch of Embench at Embedded World.
The launch was covered exclusively by Electronics Weekly:

<A HREF="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/embench-launch-embedded-world-2020-02/">https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/embench-launch-embedded-world-2020-02/</A>

The meeting will consider what (if anything) to submit to Hot Chips -
deadline is 23 March.
