Thanks to all those who raised issues and provided responses.

4. Update on benchmarks
- -----------------------

The embench-iot-results repository now captures the Embench 0.5
results for Arm Cortex M4 and RISC-V RI5CY.  Pull requests for other
architectures very welcome.

Roger Shepherd has raised the issue of widening results to increase
credibility and has volunteered to provide data for ST dev
boards, Macs and Rasberry Piâ€™s.

ACTION: Roger Shepherd to provide Embench results for ST dev boards,
Apple Macs and Raspberry Pi.

ACTION: Jeremy Bennett/Paolo Savini to attempt to get results for
Atmel AVR using Arduino.

Volunteers for more platforms are welcome

5. Publicity
- ------------

David Patterson has made a submission to Arm TechCon for this year.

We now have a Wikipedia page: <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embench.">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embench.</A>
Please edit to improve.

ACTION: Jeremy Bennett to add link to results page.

Jeremy Bennett's slides from the London meetup in January are now
online for others to use. NOTE they predate the release of 0.5 and the
Arm Cortex M4 baseline, so the data needs updating. See
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YW5sXZODsCitqGw6mWBzSMtAKQQtYRK61JHj3FkymZY.">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YW5sXZODsCitqGw6mWBzSMtAKQQtYRK61JHj3FkymZY.</A>
Google presentations struggle with error bars on graphs, so the graphs
are all images copied from LibreOffice calc.

Bill McSpadden noted that Google Docs/G-drive are not supported in China.

ACTION: Jeremy Bennett to explore alternatives - possibly restructured
text or hieroglyph, which could be held in a repository.

6. Embench 0.6
- --------------

At our last meeting we all took an action to consider new benchmarks
that could be included in a floating-point Embench suite.  There is a
shared document to add these:
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ</A>

Discussion of future benchmarks
- - Nikos Fragoulis has C code benchmarks in Irida Labs. Have managed to
fit deep learning network on Cortex M0, process images at 5
frames/second. Any benchmark would be open, but have to use
non-proprietary or random data.
- - Ray Simar suggested ideas from the TinyML book by Pete Worden and
Daniel Situnayake. He could give his fall students a project to come
up with a new
- - BDTI kernel benchmarks - set of 12 kernels, FIR, IIR, FFT, vector
operations etc. Offer to make some of their benchmarks available. Good
low level DSP benchmarks.

ACTION: Nikos Fragoulis to propose benchmark and suitable data.

ACTION: Ray Simar to set class project to come up with new benchmarks
based on the TinyML book.

ACTION: David Patterson to convene a meeting with Ray Simar and Jeff
Bier to discuss use of BDTI benchmarks, including how they would be
licensed (anything GPL compatible is fine).

A reminder that we need volunteers to lead particular aspects of the
effort.

7. Future meetings
- ------------------

Future meetings will be 1 hour long.

We currently meet regularly on the third Monday of each month 8-10am
California time. Our future meetings will be. Note that 2 dates have
been changed to accommodate upcoming conferences/holidays.
- - Mon 20 Jul 2020
- - Mon 10 Aug 2020 (changed)
- - Mon 21 Sep 2020
- - Mon 19 Oct 2020
- - Mon 16 Nov 2020
- - Mon 14 Dec 2020 (changed)

I've created a calendar entry for our regular attendees, to provide
automated reminders. Please ask if you wish to be added to this.

8. AOB
- ------

Paul Butcher introduced his work on fuzzing for security using Embench.

Best wishes,


Jeremy
