4. Update on benchmarks
- -----------------------

The embench-iot-results repository now captures the Embench 0.5
results for Arm Cortex M4 and RISC-V RI5CY.  Pull requests for other
architectures very welcome.

Roger Shepherd has raised the issue of widening results to increase
credibility.  He writes:

&quot;I think both the credibility and usefulness of benchmarks goes up as
the result base widens. I think we should encourage the generation of
results for a range of processor/platforms - even if they from systems
that are not the target of our benchmarks. I’ll volunteer to produce
some over the summer on platforms I have easy access to - e.g. ST dev
boards, Macs, Pi’s.&quot;

5. Publicity
- ------------

David Patterson has made a submission to Arm TechCon for this year.

We now have a Wikipedia page: <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embench.">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embench.</A>
Please edit to improve.

Jeremy Bennett's slides from the London meetup in January are now
online for others to use. NOTE they predate the release of 0.5 and the
Arm Cortex M4 baseline, so the data needs updating. See
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YW5sXZODsCitqGw6mWBzSMtAKQQtYRK61JHj3FkymZY.">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YW5sXZODsCitqGw6mWBzSMtAKQQtYRK61JHj3FkymZY.</A>
Google presentations struggle with error bars on graphs, so the graphs
are all images copied from LibreOffice calc.

Report on other conferences upcoming.

6. Embench 0.6
- --------------

At our last meeting we all took an action to consider new benchmarks
that could be included in a floating-point Embench suite.  There is a
shared document to add these:
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tC0LXZRYeyoSRTM9aXtapzx3sA00vfFcL9QjOxU3vzQ</A>

An opportunity to discuss.

A reminder that we need volunteers to lead particular aspects of the
effort.

7. Next meeting
- ---------------

We currently meet regularly on the third Monday of each month 8-10am
California time. Our future meetings will be. Note that 2 dates have
been changed to accommodate upcoming conferences/holidays.
- - Mon 20 Jul 2020
- - Mon 10 Aug 2020 (changed)
- - Mon 21 Sep 2020
- - Mon 19 Oct 2020
- - Mon 16 Nov 2020
