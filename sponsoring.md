title: "Sponsoring FOSSi Foundation"
---

The Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation fosters free and
open source semiconductor designâ€‹. The Foundation is working toward a
mature free and open source digital design ecosystem, the benefits of
which include faster time to market with better tested, free and open
semiconductor designs and ultimately cheaper and more secure
electronics.

Inspired by the success of free and open source software, the FOSSi
Foundation will help bring about IP and tools of comparable quality to
proprietary offerings, and which are developed according to an open
source model by a highly collaborative and inclusive community.

The FOSSi Foundation will address the issues the field currently
faces; fragmentation, legal uncertainty, design quality, and high
barriers to entry. We are asking for sponsors to help us work towards
our goals throughout 2017 and beyond, and ask that you consider
sponsoring or donating to the FOSSi Foundation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

In the following we answer frequently asked questions and give
examples of how you and the broader community can benefit from our
activities.

### Who are the people behind the FOSSi Foundation?

We have started the FOSSi Foundation from within the free and open
source silicon community with the goal to have a robust,
community-controlled instance to support the community with resources
and a platform.

The FOSSi Foundation is formed of individual members that elect the
[board of directors](/organization) to follow the goals. The board
forms [committees](/organization) of experts from our members and a
broader community with the mandate to steer our activities.

### What are your goals?

In a brief summary our goal is to help the community with building
quality free and open source silicon, tools and the related ecosystem.

We believe that everyone benefits from a an active and mature
ecosystem around free and open source silicon: hobbyists, academia and
industry.

You can find a more extensive description of our values and goals in
our [manifesto](/manifesto).

### What is the legal status of FOSSi Foundation?

The FOSSi Foundation is
[registered as a Community Interest Company](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09848956)
in the UK and operates worldwide. A Community Interest Company is a
special form of a limited corporation that can only operate in the
interest of the community. Beyond that a binding asset lock applies,
that forbids to pay dibidends or extract any assets from the
foundation.

With this company form and our [organization](/organization) we have
established a robust, vendor-independent, community-oriented legal
entity to work towards our goals.

### How will my funds be used?

We use the funds to move our [goals](/manifesto) forward. We believe
we started and run the [projects](/projects) and
[committees](/organization) that perfectly fit the needs of the
community. You can find more details about our plans for 2017 in the
[sponsorship proposal](/assets/SponsorshipProposal-Feb17.pdf).
