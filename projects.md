<td><b>LibreCores</b> is a community hub for FOSSi. We have recently started the development of the interactive functionality and have many plans for this project. It was one of the original reasons we started the FOSSi Foundation.</td>

<td><b>ORCONF</b> is the annual conference we organize. It originally started as an OpenRISC user meeting in Stockholm in 2012 and Cambridge in 2013. The covered topics have broadened in Munich in 2014, where we also had first talks from the RISC-V community. In 2015 at Cern in Geneva it has then grown to an even larger event with nearly 100 attendees and covered OpenRISC, RISC-V/lowRISC, other cool FOSSi projects and EDA tools. ORCONF 2016 was hosted in Bologna and attracted 120 attendees presenting a large variety of projects.</td>
