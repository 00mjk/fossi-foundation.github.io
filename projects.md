    Finding a suitable license for contributions in the open source world can sometimes be tricky.
    The FOSSi Foundation is actively involved in helping users choose licenses which suit their needs.
    We realize, that for some scenarios existing licenses are not sufficient.
    We are working with lawyers to extend existing licenses, or to create new one as necessary.
