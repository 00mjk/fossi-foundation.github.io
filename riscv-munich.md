title: "Open Source Silicon with RISC-V"
---

In cooperation with the Technical University of Munich, FOSSi
Foundation organizes a community event in
**Munich, 23.3.2017, 16.00h - 19.00h**

The RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) has gained a lot of
attention recently, for example as the "Analyst's Choice: Technology
of the Year 2016" of the Linley Group. It was originally designed to
support research and education, but is on the path to become the open
standard architecture for industry. The RISC-V ISA is free and open,
designed by professionals and allows custom extensions. It is now
governed by the RISC-V Foundation with many industry members. Among
the emerging open implementations, lowRISC aims at creating a fully
open-sourced, Linux-capable, RISC-V-based SoC. lowRISC is a flagship
example for the advances of Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi).

In this afternoon event the creators of RISC-V and lowRISC will
provide an overview of their projects. Beside that the FOSSi
Foundation will give a brief overview of open-source digital hardware
and its related activities.

**Location: TU München, Lecture Hall N1179,
[Theresienstraße 90, 80333 München](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=48.1502&mlon=11.5685#map=15/48.1502/11.5685&layers=T)**

There also are **"Birds of a Feather" sessions on
[Friday](#birds-of-a-feather-sessions)**.

### RISC-V: Instruction Sets Want to Be Free
**Krste Asanović, University of California, Berkeley**

The free and open RISC-V ISA has seen recent uptake around the
world. This talk will cover the technical features of the RISC-V ISA
design , which has the goals of scaling from the tiniest
implementations for IoT up to the largest warehouse-scale computers,
with support for extensive customization. The talk will also cover the
governance of the RISC-V ISA, in particular the setup of the RISC-V
Foundation. More information [http://riscv.org](http://riscv.org)

### lowRISC
**Rob Mullins, Alex Bradbury, University of Cambridge**

The lowRISC platform aims to be the "Linux of the hardware world",
providing a high quality, secure, and open base for derivative
designs. Our goal is to lower the barrier of entry to producing custom
silicon, establishing a vibrant ecosystem around secure and open
hardware designs. lowRISC was formed as a not-for-profit
community-driven organisation to pursue these aims. This talk will
explore our current status and roadmap, describing our novel platform
features such as tagged memory and minion cores. More information:

### Free and Open Source Silicon
**Stefan Wallentowitz, Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation**

The FOSSi Foundation is a community-controlled not-for-profit
organization with the mission to promote and assist free and open
digital hardware design and their ecosystem. In this presentation you
will learn about our goals and activities. More information:

## Birds of a Feather Sessions

On Friday, March 24, we will hold "Birds of a Feather" sessions at TU
Munich in room N2128. The idea is to have some more in-depth 60-minute
discussions and gather your ideas and opinions. Based on the feedback
we received so far about your interests we have the following sessions
in mind:

**9.00-10.00** Open Source ASICs (How can they happen? Challenges and opportunities)

**10.00-11.00** RISC-V Foundation and the RISC-V standards evolution (Governance framework, privileged spec, debug spec)

**11.00-12.00** RISC-V software ecosystem (State of the ecosystem, compiler customization)

**12.00-13.00** RISC-V security

There will be sufficient time for discussions and coffee breaks, the
timeframes are only a general guidance if you want to drop in for a
specific topic.

Please [get in touch](mailto:stefan@fossi-foundation.org) with us if
you have ideas for other sessions.
