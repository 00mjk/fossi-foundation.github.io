                          <ul>
                            <li>Tel-Aviv: 2.5 hours</li>
                            <li>Munich: 3 hours</li>
                            <li>Moscow: 3.5 hours</li>
                            <li>London: 4 hours</li>

                            <li>San Francisco: 13 hours</li>
                          </ul>
                        There are two airports in Istanbul, the large and brand new <a href="https://www.istairport.com/en">Istanbul Airport (IST)</a> and the <a href="https://www.sabihagokcen.aero/homepage">Sabiha Gokcen (ISG)</a> airport on the asian side that serves a lot of the cheaper carriers. These two are more than 80km apart from each other. Technically the venue is closer to the main Istanbul Airport, but as the university is on the outer ring roads, it is possible to come from Sabiha Gokcen as well.</p>    

                        <p>From the airport, it is actually very fast and practical to come to the university. See the note on public transport below. Go to the level with busses <a href="https://www.istairport.com/tr/announcements_web/PublishingImages/peron-1.pdf">see platform map</a>. Pick the bus IST-5 going to Besiktas (Platform 15, every 30 minutes, more expensive) and leave at the first stop (it will take some time) Emniyetevler or 4.Levent. This is directly by the <a href="https://www.metro.istanbul/en/Hatlarimiz/HatDetay?hat=M2">M2</a> metro stop <I>4.Levent</I>, 3 stops from the venue.</p>

                    </figure>


                        <p>Second option, <a href="https://www.iett.istanbul/en/main/hatlar/H-2/MEC%C4%B0D%C4%B0YEK%C3%96Y%20-%20%C4%B0STANBUL%20HAVAL%C4%B0MANI-%C4%B0ETT-Otob%C3%BCs-Sefer-Saatleri-ve-Duraklar%C4%B1">H-2</a> (Platform 9, every 15 minutes, slower, cheaper), its last stop is directly by the <a href="https://www.metro.istanbul/en/Hatlarimiz/HatDetay?hat=M2">M2</a> metro stop <I>Sisli-Mecidiyekoy</I>, 6 stops from the venue.</p>

                        <p>Since the airport is far away, and there is not much around it (yet), there is not much traffic on this road. Especially IST-5, will lose very little time until its first scheduled stop, making it a very good connection (not all busses go that easily) If the bus is empty, and there is a bit of traffic, you can maybe convince the driver to let you off at the <a href="https://www.metro.istanbul/en/Hatlarimiz/HatDetay?hat=M2">M2</a> metro stop <I>Sanayi</I> (not a regular stop) which is on its way, but is even closer to our venue.</p>

See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Turkey">Wikipedia page on the Visa policy of Turkey</a>, which is easier to parse, but please for any official business rely on websites with the official gov.tr addresses.</p>

                      <ul>
                        <p>Unless you want to suffer, <strong>do not think about</strong> renting a car in Istanbul. Driving is not only dangerous, but ultimately very frustrating as roads are usually congested and finding parking spots is a nightmare. Taxis are actually quite cheap, but most of them will not take credit cards. <a href="https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/istanbul/">Uber</a> has an agreement with Istanbul, you will be getting taxis that are in the system. However, for most connections, these taxis will also be driving the same congested roads. </p>

                        <p>The fastest way to travel in Istanbul is to take the <a href="https://www.metro.istanbul/en/">Metro</a> (with a few exceptions with the airports). Fortunately, the conference venue is right on one of the <strong>key</strong> Metro lines, the <a href="https://www.metro.istanbul/en/Hatlarimiz/HatDetay?hat=M2">M2</a> (green in maps). This line connects the old part (with tourist attractions), the modern part (shopping and entertainment) and the university where we have the meeting. You can get more <a href="https://www.metro.istanbul/YolcuHizmetleri/AgHaritalari">information on the metro network</a> and <a href="https://www.metro.istanbul/Content/assets/uploaded/%C4%B0stanbul%20Rayl%C4%B1%20Sistemler%20Haritas%C4%B1.pdf">download the network map here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Conveniently all public transportation systems (busses, trams, metros, boats) use the same payment system <a href="https://www.istanbulkart.istanbul/">Istanbulkart</a>. You can get one at the airport(s) <a href="https://www.istanbulkart.istanbul/istanbul-havalimani-1142">bus terminal (<i>site in Turkish</i>)</a>. The yellow boxes are recharging stations (they accept only Turkish banknotes), and the blue boxes also dispense the cards (costs about 1 EUR). You can top up any amount you want on the card and use it as you want. Note that it pays off to have one card per person, as there is a significant reduction for follow-up trips. This only works if everyone uses a separate card. But if needed you can use the same card to pay for multiple people as well.</p>

                        <p>While driving (and busses) is chaotic in a huge city like Istanbul, the <a href="http://en.sehirhatlari.istanbul/en">boats</a> connecting the two sides of the city are very reliable, punctual and very scenic. You do not need to look for the more touristic <i>Bosphorus tours</i>, any regular (and cheap) trip is a fun way to see the city. </p>

                        <p>Actually, no place is really called Istanbul. The city consists of several municipalities and they have always had very different characteristics. The map above very roughly denotes the regions:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Traditional part</strong>: This is <i>the</i> historical part with the main tourist attractions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople">Sultanahmet</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emin%C3%B6n%C3%BC">Eminönü</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirkeci">Sirkeci</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horn">Golden Horn</a> are names you will hear.</li>
                            <li><strong>Modern part</strong>: Even during Ottoman times, the foreigners lived here, it is a lively part with many different cultures. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_Square">Taksim</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karak%C3%B6y">Karakoy</a> is more 20th century architecture as you go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Ei%C5%9Fli">Şişli</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levent">Levent</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiler">Etiler</a> skyscrapers start to dominate.</li>
                            <li><strong>University region</strong>: This is where the meeting is, technically it is part of the modern city, the region around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslak">Maslak</a>. Note that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Istanbul">
                            many universities in Istanbul</a> (more than 30), this map only refers to the university (ITU) where out meeting is.</li>

                    </figure>

                            <li><strong>Asian part</strong>: Geographically speaking, this part is in Asia. More people live in this part and work on the other side, so there is a large intercontinental flow of people in the mornings and evenings. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kad%C4%B1k%C3%B6y">Kadıköy</a> (modern) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar">Üsküdar</a> (traditional) are the most well known places. </li>
                          </ul>  
                      Note that the Metro line <a href="https://www.metro.istanbul/en/Hatlarimiz/HatDetay?hat=M2">M2</a> connects our conference venue to both the <i>Modern</i> part and the <I>Traditional</I> part directly. At its terminus station you can switch to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmaray">Marmaray</a> (railline under the Bosphorus) to get to the <i>Asian</i> part as well. 
                      </ul>
                    </p>


                    <p>
                      <strong>Where to stay?</strong>
                      <ul>
                        <p>
                          There are hotels closer to the venue (The <a href="https://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/turkey/hilton-istanbul-maslak-ISTMAHI/index.html">Hilton Maslak</a> is directly outside the campus on the other side of the road. However, we would recommend you to stay in around Taksim as it offers a lot of entertainment and vibrant night life, and it is directly on the Metro line <a href="https://www.metro.istanbul/en/Hatlarimiz/HatDetay?hat=M2">M2</a>. Basically any location on the Metro line is fine, with the following stops offering the best options:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Taksim (8 stops) : nightlife, good restaurants, central </li>
                            <li>Sishane (9 stops) : End of the street that starts in Taksim, lively</li>
                            <li>Vezneciler (11 stops): close to historical center, touristic, cheaper</li>
                            <li>Osmanbey (7 stops) : 70s blocks, shopping </li>
                            <li>Sisli-Mecidiyekoy, Gayrettepe (5-6 stops) newer high rises</li>
                          </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>A word of caution. Istanbul is a very hilly city (it is also called the city of seven hills - Yeditepe). Things that look reasonably close on the map, may be very difficult to get to.</p>
                      </ul>
                    </p>


                    <p>
                      <strong>What to do?</strong>
                      <ul>
                        <p>Istanbul will entertain you for a long time. The highlights are actually all conveniently located around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople">Sultanahmet</a> square (but there is really much more). Do not miss:
                          <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> (no matter how long the queue, it is worth it)</li>
                            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Bazaar,_Istanbul">Grand Bazaar</a> (free)</li>
                            <li>Walk around the Hippodrome (free)</li>
                          </ul>
                        Many guides will send you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topkap%C4%B1_Palace">Topkapi palace</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Ahmed_Mosque">Blue mosque</a>. These are both fine, but if you want some history, the <a href="https://muze.gov.tr/muze-detay?SectionId=IAR01&DistId=IAR">Istanbul Archeological Museums</a> are less crowded and contain spectacular pieces, as for mosques the <a href="">Suleymaniye Mosque</a> or if you are into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iznik_pottery">Iznik tiles</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCstem_Pasha_Mosque">Rüstem Pasha Mosque</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokollu_Mehmed_Pasha_Mosque_(Kad%C4%B1rga)">Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque</a> are much finer examples to see.  
                        </p>

                        <p>For a scenic trip consider starting from Sirkeci and go to Harem using the car ferry (it costs the same), then walk on the coast towards Uskudar. You will come to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salacak">Salacak</a> with one of the best views of the city, very close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden%27s_Tower">Leander Tower</a>. While the small island is very scenic and it is possible to visit it, it actually makes little sense as you will be missing this scenic tower from the view if you are standing there. The walk should take less than half an hour, and you will reach Uskudar from where you can either take a ship back to Eminonu or Karakoy or use the Metro to get back to Eminonu to complete the tour. </p>

                        <p>In a very large city like Istanbul, traditional review sites are not much help. Ask some of the locals you meet at FOSSistanbul for their recommendations.</p>

                        <p>The <a href="https://muze.gov.tr/">official site</a> for purchasing tickets and reduction cards can help you get discount cards. Note that the <a href="https://muze.gov.tr/MuseumPass">Museum Pass</a> is valid for 5 days but is quite pricey (about 40-50EUR). Only do this if you are a museum freak. A good tip is to purchase the card from a lesser visited museum like <a href="https://muze.gov.tr/muze-detay?SectionId=TIE01&DistId=TIE">Turkish and Islamic Art Museum</a> also right at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople">Sultanahmet</a> square. While the museum is certainly worth a visit, there are hardly crowds in front of it, allowing you to quickly buy the Museum pass.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Food</strong>
                      <ul>
                        <p>Turkish food is more varied than what is known abroad. Good restaurants are expected to specialize, and it is common to have restaurants that only sell one type of food. These are generally better, as they only prepare and sell one type of food, which is therefore always quite fresh. Touristic regions are known to have restaurants targeting tourists, and once there, people will try to lure you in. Do not worry, nobody will be offended if you do not enter. Istanbul offers to many options for food, for all apettites, you will not go home hungry. Try the following while you are there, so that you can claim that you had something different: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simit">Simit</a> (street food), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavuk_g%C3%B6%C4%9Fs%C3%BC">Tavuk göğsü</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazandibi">Kazandibi</a> a sweet pudding with chicken breast, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuffed_mussels">Midye Dolma</a> stuffed mussels (street food), for the more adventorous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoretsi">Kokorec</a> a delicious street food (better do not ask what is inside), and of course have copious amounts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_in_Turkey">tea</a>. In case you are wondering, the most traditional dish in Turkey is actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_fasulye">stewed white beans</a> usually with a side serving of rice, and not kebap.</p>

                    </figure>


                        <p>Turkish people enjoy alcohol as much as any other nation, and there are many shops, bars, restaurants that will sell alcohol. Beer is very popular, wine is quite expensive, and the national drink <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rak%C4%B1">Rakı</a> which is usually enjoyed as part of a larger meal. However, not all restaurants are licensed to sell alcohol, and traditionally certain types of restaurants/food are not considered to match with alcohol. Doner kebap for example is traditionally not enjoyed with alcohol, while fish is usually paired with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rak%C4%B1">Rakı</a>. 

                        <p>Once agan, in a very large city like Istanbul, traditional review sites are not much help (The favorite restaurants of Frank, who was born and raised in Istanbul are rated 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, and 4.0 at Tripadvisor). Ask some of the locals you meet at FOSSistanbul for their recommendations, and also ask them what to eat there.</p>
