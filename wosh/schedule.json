    "abstract": "The CERN Open Hardware Licence has proved popular for electronics, and the current draft of version 2 aims to widen its appeal by addressing issues raised by developers of ASICs and FPGAs, as well as other forms of hardware. It simplifies and clarifies previous versions, and introduces weak reciprocal (copyleft) and permissive variants. By introducing the concept of an \u2018available component\u2019 it clarifies the scope of the copyleft effect, and the new version may even provide a solution to some tricky licensing problems which are starting to arise in the software domain (such as containerisation).\n",

The academic licenses, which are provided, have certain legal restrictions, which are currently not compatible with the creation of Open Source Hardware. In the talk Cadence University Program Manager EMEA, Anton Klotz, will propose a way, how the academic terms and conditions can be changed in order to become compatible with Open Source Hardware, while protecting Cadence commercial interests.",

    "title": "The role of software in validating silicon IP",
    "category": "ip",
    "abstract": "Application software has for a long time been used to validate silicon\nIP, particularly processor IP. However the approach can be misused.\nFor more than a decade it was the *only* way OpenRISC was validated,\nusing a handful of small embedded programs. If these gave the correct\nresult, printing out \"DEADBEEF\", then the processor was deemed\ncorrect. It was only when Ahmed Waqas of KTH Stockholm carried out a\nfull UVM analysis for his Masters dissertation\n(http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:346202/FULLTEXT01.pdf)\nthat we learned 13 instructions were not present in the reference or1k\nimplementation, because they were never generated by the compiler.\n\nHowever when used in conjunction with the correct modeling\ntechnologies, application software can be a powerful adjunct to\ntraditional hardware verification in ensuring not only that the\nsilicon has been correctly implemented, but that what it implements is\nwhat is required for the actual product. This is not a new technique -\nit was used by David Greaves and others in the implementation of the\nVirata Helium 210 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1196363) two\ndecades ago. However modern modeling techniques and high performance\ncomputing make it much more tractable.\n\nIn this talk, I'll illustrate the techniques that can be used, from\nhigh level transaction modeling through to event driven simulation and\nshow how they can be combined in hybrid modeling to give both\nperformance and accuracy. I'll illustrate the talk by showing how\nEmbecosm uses this approach to bring up compilers and operating\nsystems pre-silicon, allowing software and hardware engineering to run\nconcurrently.\n",
