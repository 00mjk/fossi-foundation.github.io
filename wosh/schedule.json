Cadence is providing around 162 tools within the program to the students and academic staff for very low membership fee. The academic licenses, which are provided, have certain legal restrictions, which are currently not compatible with the creation of Open Source Hardware. In the talk Cadence University Program Manager EMEA, Anton Klotz, will propose a way, how the academic terms and conditions can be changed in order to become compatible with Open Source Hardware, while protecting Cadence commercial interests."

    "abstract": "In this presentation I will introduce the \"Journal of Open Hardware\" to\ndiscuss the promises and challenges of creating a culture of hardware\nsharing in academia. First, I will describe the publication format we\ndevised (\"HW metapaper\") for documenting open scientific instruments.\nThen, I will explain the importance of creating a library of \"prior art\"\nfor future hardware projects. For the conclusion, I will examine the\nchallenges of documenting and publishing hardware based on actual papers\nfrom various disciplines, including but not limited to bioengineering,\nmanagement, economics, and education."

This raises the serious\nquestion of whether it is even possible to have \"open hardware\"\nbeyond RTL.  I will discuss the efabless, Inc. model, the challenge\nof protecting proprietary information on an otherwise open platform,\nand what measures we have taken to secure the blessing of foundries. "
