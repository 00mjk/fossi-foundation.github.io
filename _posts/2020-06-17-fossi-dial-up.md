FOSSi Foundation launches a new event series named FOSSi Dial-up. It consists of
monthly online events that features distinctive speakers from the FOSSi
community. By dedicating one hour of presentation plus time for questions, it is
set up to become the premier event for major announcements and focused in-depth
technical content from all areas of the community.

The "first season" of the series covers an impressive project: Skywater - a
production-ready open source process development kit (PDK) for 130 nm. The
availability of an open PDK along with standard cells, RAMs, etc. is one of the
last missing links for an entirely open source chip design flow.

In the inaugural event, Tim Ansell of Google will present the current state of
the PDK and its roadmap.

The first FOSSi Dial-up 2020-06 will be live streamed on Youtube, followed by a
Q&A session. It will take place on

The event is free-to-attend, of course.

The schedule following the inaugural presentation will for another couple of
sessions be focused on presentations around the efforts to make the SkyWater
130nm PDK a viable alternative for truly open source chip production. Speakers
will be Matt Guthaus (OpenRAM for SkyWater 130nm), Mohamed Shalan (OpenROAD for
SkyWater 130nm), Tim Edwards (EDA tool Magic for DRC checks on SkyWater 130nm)
and James Stine (Standard cells for SkyWater 130nm). More talks will follow!
