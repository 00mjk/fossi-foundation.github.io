As the foundation's kickoff and our first official event we invite you
to the *FOSSi Weekend* from October 9 to October 11 at CERN in
Geneva. This event evolved from the traditional [OpenRISC Conference
(ORCONF)](http://orconf.io) which was held the last years. The scope
of ORCONF was always larger than OpenRISC and we are open to all
topics along the lines of open source silicon designs. A growing
community we are happy to team up with evolves around
[lowRISC](http://lowrisc.io) and [RISC-V](http://riscv.org) and we are
happy to integrate the lowRISC/RISC-V user meeting together with
ORCONF on this weekend. We finally plan to form the community
foundation offically during this weekend.
