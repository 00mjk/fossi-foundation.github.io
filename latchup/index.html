              On Friday May 3rd, prior to the weekend of Latch-Up, we will host a hackfest for
              <a href="https://code.timvideos.us/home/" target="_blank">Tim Videos</a>, a live video recording project built entirely out of open source hardware, gateware and software.
            </p>
            <p>
              This will be suitable for users, developers and anyone curious about getting involved with the <a href="https://code.timvideos.us/home/" target="_blank">Tim Videos</a> project.
              Helping out on the day will be the man himself, <a href="https://twitter.com/mithro" target="_blank">Tim Ansell</a> and Carl Karsten of
              <a href="http://nextdayvideo.com/" target="_blank">Next Day Video</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The day will center around hacking on <a href="https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv/wiki" target="_blank">litex-buildenv</a> with a focus on
              the <a href="https://hdmi2usb.tv/home/" target="_blank">HDMI2USB firmware</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv/wiki" target="_blank">litex-buildenv</a>
              project is an SoC with 3 architectural flavours of micrprocessor to choose from; LM32 (lm32), RISC-V (3 implementations!) and OpenRISC 1000 (mor1kx).
              As for software, you can run code bare metal, in <a href="https://micropython.org/" target="_blank">micropython</a>, and on OSes such as
              <a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/" target="_blank">Zephyr</a> and Linux. The system builds with

	      <p>
		Technically speaking, latch-up is a short circuit, an inadvertent path of low-impedance. We have co-opted this word to represent what we’d like to encourage among members of the community: paths of communication leading to collaboration, inadvertent or not.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Latch-Up 2019 in Portland opens a new chapter for the FOSSi Foundation, with it being the first event in the spirit of <a href="https://orconf.org">ORConf</a> held in North America. Latch-Up is a community-focused conference for open source semiconductor, digital design and embedded systems professionals and enthusiasts. Expect presentations on a wide range of topics; open source IP blocks and SoCs, open source simulators, compilers, synthesis and physical implementation tools for both FPGA and ASIC.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Latch-Up aims to bring together the North American open source digital design community for an event in the mould of ORConf - the FOSSi Foundation’s annual European community conference. Like ORConf, Latch-Up will be will be free to attend and consist of a relaxed format of presentations and discussions throughout a weekend, with plenty of time for networking. A dinner on the Saturday evening will be arranged and all attendees are invited to attend.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		These events go to the FOSSi Foundation's goal of lowering barriers of entry to the digital design field, whilst encouraging the open source development model and promoting open collaboration.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		We recognise the keen interest in this area in the Americas and this year are putting effort into organizing an event which will encourage wider awareness amongst enthusiasts of the projects that we’ve been hearing about at ORConf since 2012.

              <h4>
                <a name="emu" href="#emu"></a>Emulation of vintage integrated circuits through die analysis and reverse-EDA</h4>
              <p>
                Despite being sold in the millions, video games based on discrete game ICs have had minimal emulation developed.
                This is primarily due to the circuitry being a literal "black box" as only the manufacturer possessed the designs.
                In addition, much of the documentation surrounding these games has disappeared over the years.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cole has been developing a process to re-implement these stubborn circuits in modern FPGAs as well as software.
                It involves extracting a transistor-level netlist from high-resolution photographs of the exposed silicon die.
                Reverse-engineering and slow simulation is achieved using tools pioneered by the visual6502 project. This is followed
                by reverse-EDA performed by custom tools being developed. The transistor-level design is automatically converted into
                a more abstract RTL circuit description.
              </p>
              <p>
                Verilog obtained from the above process will be ported to the tinyFPGA board, the
                <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki" target="_blank">MiSTer hardware emulation project</a>,
                and the MAME software emulator. The intermediate files will be open-source in the spirit of the target projects.

              <p>
                Coding can be fun, there are many people coding in their free time just for fun. FPGA's unique features and capabilities makes it
                an attractive target for enthusiasms. VerilogBoy is such an FPGA project, that is built simply for fun. The
                <a href="https://github.com/zephray/VerilogBoy" target="_blank">VerilogBoy</a> project consists of two parts. The first part is
                implementing a GameBoy compatible machine in Verilog. The second part is building an FPGA-based handheld game console.
              </p>
              <p>
                This presentation will run through the process of the creation of the project, share some of the experience along the way,

              <p>
                Chip designers use multiple forms of illustrations to present information of technical nature quickly and clearly. Illustrations
                employed to mobilize human visual system ability to recognize trends, patterns and differences. Some forms of illustrations are
                universally accepted. Data tables, plots, line charts, mechanical drawings can be used to communicate information to the general public.
                Specialized diagram types (like UML) can be reused from software or system design practice. Such diagrams are capable of describing
                complex structure or behavior and convey this information to the broad science and engineering community.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like any other specific field of science / engineering -- chip designers developed own specialized visual language to communicate
                complex ideas with clarity, precision and efficiency. Schematic symbols; timing, circuit, layout diagrams were originally developed
                for paper medium, now migrated into electronic documentation. Many design tools exists to create illustrations and diagrams.
                From generic to specialized. Some require freehand drawing skills, some perform automatic layout.
              </p>
              <p>
                This talk is about ideas, principles and tools that would help you to create good diagrams.

                </h4>
              <p>
		Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM) is an ASIC
		level VHDL verification methodology that is simple enough to use
		even on small FPGA projects. OSVVM offers the same capabilities
		as other verification languages such as SystemVerilog and UVM.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		This presentation provides an overview of OSVVM's capabilities, including:
		<li>Transaction-Based Modeling</li>
		<li>Constrained Random test generation</li>
		<li>Functional Coverage with hooks for UCIS coverage database integration</li>
		<li>Intelligent Coverage Random test generation</li>
		<li>Utilities for testbench process synchronization</li>
		<li>Transcript files</li>
		<li>Error logging and reporting – Alerts and Affirmations</li>
		<li>Message filtering – Logs</li>
		<li>Scoreboards and FIFOs (data structures for verification)</li>
		<li>Memory models</li>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		OSVVM is implemented as a library of free, open-source packages.
		It uses these packages to create features that rival language
		based implementations in both conciseness, simplicity, and capability.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		In exciting news, The 2018 Wilson Research Group ASIC and FPGA
		Functional Verification Study, which is sponsored by one of the
		EDA vendors revealed that OSVVM is the number 1 VHDL FPGA verification library.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Looking to improve your VHDL FPGA verification methodology?
		OSVVM provides a complete solution for VHDL ASIC or FPGA
		verification. There is no new language to learn. It is simple,
		powerful, and concise. Each piece can be used separately. Hence,
		you can learn and adopt pieces as you need them."

              <p>
                In many ways, HDL developers have been many years behind their counterparts in the software world.
                One such area is core management. Where the software developers simply specify which libraries they
                depend on, HDL developers rely on copying around source code. Where software developers can select
                their build tool with a flick of a switch, HDL developers use tool-specific project files powered by
                custom makefiles.
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc" target="_blank">FuseSoC</a> rectifies this by bringing a modern
                package manager and a uniform build system to HDL developers, making it easy to reuse existing code,
                change tools and move projects between FPGAs from different vendors. Having been around for seven years
                there are now hundreds of FuseSoC-compatible cores and 14 different simulation, synthesis and lint tools
                supported. This presentation will give an overview of where FuseSoC can help spending less time on the
                cores, and more time on the core business

                and performance validation.
              </p>
              <p>
                To model I/O, FireSim includes synthesizeable and timing-accurate models for standard
                interfaces like DRAM, Ethernet, UART, and others. By providing a framework to automate the management of FPGA
                infrastructure, FireSim also lets software developers get a head-start on building software for a novel hardware
                design, by letting these developers interact with the pre-silicon hardware design as they would a virtual machine.
                In effect, both hardware and software developers work from a single source of truth: the RTL for the hardware design.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally developed to simulate new datacenter architectures, FireSim is capable of scaling to simulating thousands
                of multi-core compute nodes, with an optional cycle-accurate network simulation tying them together. Leveraging
                AWS EC2 F1, FireSim removes the high capex traditionally involved in large-scale FPGA-based simulation, democratizing
                access to realistic pre-silicon hardware modeling of new designs. For designs that contain RISC-V SoCs,
                FireSim also provides compatible Linux distributions (Buildroot, Fedora) and automates the process of building complex
                workloads on top of these Linux distributions. By harnessing a standardized host platform and providing a large amount
                of automation/tooling, FireSim drastically simplifies the process of building and deploying large-scale FPGA-based
                hardware simulations.

              <p>
                In this talk, we cover the open-source FireSim framework, explore how users can use and modify
                the existing designs available in FireSim, and show how users can integrate and measure their own hardware designs.

              <p>
                Many of the high-level synthesis (HLS) approaches take existing procedural programming languages, such as the
                C programming language, and add extensions to the language (e.g. pragmas) to accommodate high-level synthesis.
                An alternate approach is to use the <a href="http://www.myhdl.org" target="_blank">myhdl</a> design patterns to
                describe HLS chunks and integrate them with existing
                event-oriented (simulation-oriented, a.k.a RTL) hardware description languages (HDL).  This approach allows a
                designer to seamlessly move between HDL and HLS levels of abstractions and use both descriptions in a single
                programming environment.

              <p>
                We present <a href="http://www.boom-core.org" target="_blank">BOOM, the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine</a>, a synthesizable and
                parameterizable open source RV64GC RISC-V processor written in the Chisel hardware construction language. BOOM is able to
                run Linux, Fedora, and other workloads both in the cloud using the FireSim FPGA simulation platform and on a taped-out academic
                chip. For researchers, BOOM serves as a highly productive platform for implementing and evaluating new high performance designs
                and accelerators.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this talk, we briefly cover BOOM, and some of its features that make it amenable to research and integration with other projects.
                We discuss integration with the FireSim, results from hardware security research tackling Spectre-like vulnerabilities, and
                opportunities for specialization with custom accelerators.

              <p>
                <a href="http://chisel-lang.org" target="_blank">Chisel 3</a> is a hardware construction language embedded in Scala that enables
                digital designers to write parameterized generators using object-oriented and functional programming abstractions. The power of
                Chisel is not the language itself, but rather the abstractions one can create to make hardware design more productive, more reusable,
                and less error-prone. Sophisticated hardware generators like Rocket-Chip, BOOM, Hwacha, and even the Google Edge TPU are implemented using Chisel.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the most common challenges for new users is bridging the gap between toy examples and these complex, powerful generators. This
                talk is an attempt to help build that bridge. Let's use higher-level abstractions and higher-order programming to build better, reusable hardware.

              <p>
                SoC integration is a complex process requiring integration of multiple design components together. Typical “reusable” Soft / Hard core component
                comes with the intricate integration story hopefully described in some human readable User Guide document. Connecting all ports, parameters,
                registers, bus interfaces, clocks, resets, sideband signals, etc. becoming a very tedious, error prone process. Multiple attempts were made
                to introduce some sort of standard metadata exchange format to express this integration intent. Most of these formats are proprietary or EDA
                vendor specific and are semi-useful in the world of open source silicon tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                DUH defines a JSON5-based document format and provides a suite of tools for handling reusable hardware components. Import tools allow extraction
                of ports, parameters, and other important integration information from available sources like Verilog, IP-XACT, SystemRDL, etc. Inference tools
                helps to reason about structure of the ports, standard bus interfaces, clocks, resets. Validation tools helps document author to maintain complete
                and consistent DUH document describing specific hardware component. Integration tools can read DUH documents to understand and satisfy an integration
                needs of these components.

              <p>
                SystemVerilog is widely used for hardware design in both academia and industry.
                <a href="https://github.com/bespoke-silicon-group/basejump_stl" target="_blank">BaseJump STL</a> is an open-source Standard Template Library
                for synthesizable SystemVerilog that sharply reduces the time required to design
                digital circuits. This talk will overview the principles that underly the design
                of the BaseJump STL, including light-weight latency-insensitive interfaces that yield fast microarchitectures and low bug
                density; thin handshaking rules; fast porting of hardened chip regions across nodes; pervasive parameterization and specialization,
                and static error checking.
              </p>
              <p>
                We then suggest extensions to SystemVerilog to make it a more functional design language, and briefly discuss validation
                of BaseJump STL through its use in past and ongoing projects.
