              More about Latch-Up
            </h5>
            <div class="card-body">
	      <p>
		Technically speaking, latch-up is a short circuit, an inadvertent path of low-impedance. We have co-opted this word to represent what weâ€™d like to encourage among members of the community: paths of communication leading to collaboration, inadvertent or not.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Latch-Up 2019 in Portland opens a new chapter for the FOSSi Foundation, with it being the first event in the spirit of <a href="https://orconf.org">ORConf</a> held in North America. Latch-Up is a community-focused conference for open source semiconductor, digital design and embedded systems professionals and enthusiasts. Expect presentations on a wide range of topics; open source IP blocks and SoCs, open source simulators, compilers, synthesis and physical implementation tools for both FPGA and ASIC.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Latch-Up aims to bring together the North American open source digital design community for an event in the mould of ORConf - the FOSSi Foundationâ€™s annual European community conference. Like ORConf, Latch-Up will be will be free to attend and consist of a relaxed format of presentations and discussions throughout a weekend, with plenty of time for networking. A dinner on the Saturday evening will be arranged and all attendees are invited to attend.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		These events go to the FOSSi Foundation's goal of lowering barriers of entry to the digital design field, whilst encouraging the open source development model and promoting open collaboration.

                <a name="emu" href="#emu"></a>Emulation of vintage integrated circuits through die analysis and reverse-EDA</h4>
              <p>
                Despite being sold in the millions, video games based on discrete game ICs have had minimal emulation developed.
                This is primarily due to the circuitry being a literal "black box" as only the manufacturer possessed the designs.
                In addition, much of the documentation surrounding these games has disappeared over the years.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cole has been developing a process to re-implement these stubborn circuits in modern FPGAs as well as software.
                It involves extracting a transistor-level netlist from high-resolution photographs of the exposed silicon die.
                Reverse-engineering and slow simulation is achieved using tools pioneered by the visual6502 project. This is followed
                by reverse-EDA performed by custom tools being developed. The transistor-level design is automatically converted into
                a more abstract RTL circuit description.
              </p>
              <p>
                Verilog obtained from the above process will be ported to the tinyFPGA board, the
                <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki" target="_blank">MiSTer hardware emulation project</a>,
                and the MAME software emulator. The intermediate files will be open-source in the spirit of the target projects.

              <p>
                Coding can be fun, there are many people coding in their free time just for fun. FPGA's unique features and capabilities makes it
                an attractive target for enthusiasms. VerilogBoy is such an FPGA project, that is built simply for fun. The
                <a href="https://github.com/zephray/VerilogBoy" target="_blank">VerilogBoy</a> project consists of two parts. The first part is
                implementing a GameBoy compatible machine in Verilog. The second part is building an FPGA-based handheld game console.

              <p>
                Chip designers use multiple forms of illustrations to present information of technical nature quickly and clearly. Illustrations
                employed to mobilize human visual system ability to recognize trends, patterns and differences. Some forms of illustrations are
                universally accepted. Data tables, plots, line charts, mechanical drawings can be used to communicate information to the general public.
                Specialized diagram types (like UML) can be reused from software or system design practice. Such diagrams are capable of describing
                complex structure or behavior and convey this information to the broad science and engineering community.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like any other specific field of science / engineering -- chip designers developed own specialized visual language to communicate
                complex ideas with clarity, precision and efficiency. Schematic symbols; timing, circuit, layout diagrams were originally developed
                for paper medium, now migrated into electronic documentation. Many design tools exists to create illustrations and diagrams.
                From generic to specialized. Some require freehand drawing skills, some perform automatic layout.
              </p>
              <p>
                This talk is about ideas, principles and tools that would help you to create good diagrams.

                </h4>
              <p>
		Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM) is an ASIC
		level VHDL verification methodology that is simple enough to use
		even on small FPGA projects. OSVVM offers the same capabilities
		as other verification languages such as SystemVerilog and UVM.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		This presentation provides an overview of OSVVM's capabilities, including:
		<li>Transaction-Based Modeling</li>
		<li>Constrained Random test generation</li>
		<li>Functional Coverage with hooks for UCIS coverage database integration</li>
		<li>Intelligent Coverage Random test generation</li>
		<li>Utilities for testbench process synchronization</li>
		<li>Transcript files</li>
		<li>Error logging and reporting â€“ Alerts and Affirmations</li>
		<li>Message filtering â€“ Logs</li>
		<li>Scoreboards and FIFOs (data structures for verification)</li>
		<li>Memory models</li>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		OSVVM is implemented as a library of free, open-source packages.
		It uses these packages to create features that rival language
		based implementations in both conciseness, simplicity, and capability.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		In exciting news, The 2018 Wilson Research Group ASIC and FPGA
		Functional Verification Study, which is sponsored by one of the
		EDA vendors revealed that OSVVM is the number 1 VHDL FPGA verification library.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Looking to improve your VHDL FPGA verification methodology?
		OSVVM provides a complete solution for VHDL ASIC or FPGA
		verification. There is no new language to learn. It is simple,
		powerful, and concise. Each piece can be used separately. Hence,
		you can learn and adopt pieces as you need them."

                transceiver-capable I/O pins at the package level. Therefore, there is no cross-compatibility advantage
                to using the same connector for both peripheral types. There are several advantages, however, including:
                lower standard connector cost, lower cable cost for standard peripherals and better pin count utilization
                for both types.

                <a name="fusesoc" href="#fusesoc"></a>FuseSoC - Cores have never been so much fun</h4>
              <p>
                In many ways, HDL developers have been many years behind their counterparts in the software world.
                One such area is core management. Where the software developers simply specify which libraries they
                depend on, HDL developers rely on copying around source code. Where software developers can select
                their build tool with a flick of a switch, HDL developers use tool-specific project files powered by
                custom makefiles.
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc" target="_blank">FuseSoC</a> rectifies this by bringing a modern
                package manager and a uniform build system to HDL developers, making it easy to reuse existing code,
                change tools and move projects between FPGAs from different vendors. Having been around for seven years
                there are now hundreds of FuseSoC-compatible cores and 14 different simulation, synthesis and lint tools
                supported. This presentation will give an overview of where FuseSoC can help spending less time on the
                cores, and more time on the core business

              <p>
                Design and Verification engineers develop code using a plethora of languages -- Verilog, SystemVerilog, C/C++, Python, Perl, etc.
                Whether developing commercial or open source IP, reuse is critical, which means that DV engineers need to efficiently
                comprehend and work with code written by others. <a href="http://dvkit.org" target="_blank">DVKit</a> is an Eclipse-based
                Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports developing in a wide variety of software and hardware description
                languages much more efficiently than can be done with a text editor.
              </p>
              <p>
                This talk will introduce you to the differences between a text editor and an IDE. We will look at features of DVKit that
                boost productivity on any type of text file, and focus on features that make navigating and developing SystemVerilog and
                Verilog designs and testbench environments more efficient and effective.

              <p>
                You may have heard of <a href="https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane" target="_blank">Ariane</a> from ETH Zurich,
                or of <a href="http://openpiton.org" target="_blank">OpenPiton</a> from Princeton University, but now from the makers
                of both, comes

              </p>
              <p>
                By modifying the Ariane RISC-V (RV64GC) coreâ€™s L1 cache interface to support the P-Mesh cache-coherence protocol, we replaced
                OpenPitonâ€™s original OpenSPARC T1 core and then enhanced P-Mesh to support RISC-V atomic operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since bringing up SMP Linux on FPGA, OpenPiton+Ariane is the first open-source, Linux-booting, RISC-V system that scales
                from single-core to manycore. OpenPiton+Ariane inherits all of the capabilities of OpenPiton and of Ariane, bringing them
                together in a single scalable, configurable, and easy-to-use platform ideal for rapid prototyping. This is all available

              <p>
                Heterogeneous-ISA processors have become a topic of research interest due to the increasing need for energy efficiency.
                Without a fully open-source implementation of a heterogeneous-ISA processor, it is difficult to test full-stack modifications.
                By connecting <a href="https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32" target="_blank">PicoRV32</a> to the
                <a href="http://openpiton.org" target="_blank">OpenPiton</a> cache system, we created
                <a href="https://abopen.com/news/juxtapiton-merges-opensparc-risc-v-soft-cores/" target="_blank">JuxtaPiton</a>,
                a heterogeneous-ISA platform with both OpenPitonâ€™s original OpenSPARC T1 cores and PicoRV32 cores.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project was the first time a new core was integrated into OpenPiton, so I will describe the process I developed
                to integrate PicoRV32 and which has since been used to connect five other cores to OpenPiton. I will also describe
                the runtime system we use to offload binaries from Linux on the SPARC core to the bare-metal environment on PicoRV32
                core and to proxy syscalls from the running binary.
