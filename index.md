Welcome to the Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation.  FOSSi
Foundation is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and
assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related
ecosystems. FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive,
vendor-independent group.

### What is Free and Open Source Silicon?

Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) are components and systems that
are inside silicon devices (‘chips’). It is our core belief that
building blocks that form such digital devices can be made free and open

### Who are we?

FOSSi Foundation was created by a group of individuals coming from industry
and academia, each with long experience in working on prominent Open Source
projects within the digital design and embedded areas. The foundation is
managed by [directors](organization), formed by the members and backed by
sponsors

### Our mission

* Support and promote open standards development and their use
* Support community events and organize regular events
* Encourage industry participation in open source IP design
* Assist hobbyists and academic institutions with opening their work
  to the public
* Support the development and maintenance of a web site, aimed at
  providing a platform for free and open source silicon

Further details about our values and goals can be found in the FOSSi
Foundation [manifesto](manifesto)
