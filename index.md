Welcome to the Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation. We are
currently in the process of forming this foundation and plan to
complete this with an official kickoff during the [FOSSi
Weekend](events/fossi-weekend-2015.html) around October 10. We are a
group of developers and open hardware enthusiasts from the
[OpenRISC](openrisc.io) community.

### Our Mission

FOSSi is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and
assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related
ecosystems. FOSSi operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent
group.

 * Support and promote open standards development and their use
 * Support community events and organize regular events
 * Encourage industry participation in open source IP design
 * Assist hobbyists and academic institutions with opening their work
   to the public
 * Support the development and maintenance of a web site, aimed at
   providing a platform for free and open source silicon
