Welcome to the Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation. We are
currently in the process of forming this foundation and will be
discussing our plans during [ORCONF 2015](http://openrisc.io/orconf)
around October 10. We are a group of developers and open hardware
enthusiasts from the [OpenRISC](http://openrisc.io) community.

### Our Mission

FOSSi will be a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and
assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related
ecosystems. FOSSi operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent
group.

 * Support and promote open standards development and their use
 * Support community events and organize regular events
 * Encourage industry participation in open source IP design
 * Assist hobbyists and academic institutions with opening their work
   to the public
 * Support the development and maintenance of a web site, aimed at
   providing a platform for free and open source silicon
